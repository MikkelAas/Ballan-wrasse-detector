# IDATG2206 Project - Group 1

## Methods

This repository contains five different object detection methods:
- Template Matching 
- SIFT
- SURF
- Blob Analysis
- YOLO v3

## Running the code

If you want to run any of this code you might need to make some changes. Most of the code will only run if you have a folder with all the images you wish to use, and all images have numbers as names that increase by 1 for each image. For instance: ``0001.jpg`` and ``0002.jpg``. The methods also include IoU score computations, which means a ground truth is needed.
